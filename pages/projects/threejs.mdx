# 3D GIS and Digital Twins

As an architect, I have experience modelling and building 3d models and conecting both GIS and BIM worlds.

<br />
Here is an example during Esri's UC23 were I conducted a workshop on digital twins
for a wind farm in the EU. I used ArcGIS Experience Builder to integrate the GIS
data with the 3D representation of the turbines and the BIM model for the control
building:

# Other 3D related apps

I can develop specific aplications involving 3d data and real-time location devices.

## Digital Twin for Sumapaz community
<br />I developed this app for the community of Sumapaz to oversee and manage
their infrastructure interactively during Covid time. See the live app here

## Coffee Satellite - coordinate submission app
<br />
I developed this simple tool for coffee farmers to summit their location to a GoogleForms
and request further assistance. See the live app here [Coffee Satellite App](https://coffee-satellite.vercel.app/)

<br />I explored the possibilities of live tracking within ArcGIS Online using
temporal data in a MapJam session at Esri Spain. I used ArcGIS Experience
Builder and created some AI images using Microsoft Designer [Where is Miss
Dangermond](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/49043d2cf09d4e1fa7d4247ea61cd47f/)
<br />I enjoy taking 3d models to the web using Three.js. In this example, I was
requested to provide an online experience for a model unit for CONHEXA, a private
real estate developer. This is the live demo [Conhexa interactive](https://conhexa.netlify.app/).
And this is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andriusmv/conhexa).

<br />
## 3D development with ThreeJs

I use React Three Fiber (R3F) (and Typescript) for
3d stuff. And I usually model in Blender (❤️). I can also provide BIM models using
the IFC.js library.
