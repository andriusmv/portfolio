# 3D models with Threejs

As an architect, I have experience modelling and building 3d models. I enjoy taking 3d models to the web using Three.js. In this example, I was requested to provide an online experience for a model unit for CONHEXA, a private real estate developer. This is the live demo [Conhexa interactive](https://conhexa.netlify.app/). And this is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andriusmv/conhexa). 
<br />
I use React Three Fiber (R3F) (and Typescript) for 3d stuff. And I usually model in Blender (❤️). I can also provide BIM models using the IFC.js library.
