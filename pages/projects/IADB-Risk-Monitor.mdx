# IADB Inter American Development Bank - Risk Monitor (web maps)

Riskmonitor is a digital tool developed by the Inter-American Development Bank to further the understanding of disaster risk and the advancement of disaster risk management for member countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.

I served as a specialist consultant in geographic information system to update and edit the Risk Monitor web maps according to specific GIS requirements. I edited the attribute table of 100+ records to optimize the publicly visible fields, optimizing the symbology and the general design of the web map for insertion on the Risk Monitor website.
I also performed quality control and testing to ensure that the edited maps met the highest IDB standards. Data accuracy verification, symbology consistency, and overall map readability of 4+ web maps before delivering the final product and hosting it on the web was achieved.
‚ÄúRecent Hurricanes, Cyclones and Typhoons‚Äù data from ArcGIS Living Atlas was tested along with other data layers to enrich the web maps.
