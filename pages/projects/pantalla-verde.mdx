# Pantalla Verde

Pantalla Verde is an educational platform (SaaS) to learn about new technologies in the AEC/RED field (architecture and construction).
It involves user authentication and authorization (PostgreSQL with Supabase), front-end with NextJS, UI with MantineUI and payment processing with Stripe webhooks.

You can find the project repo here: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andriusmv/pantallaverde) and the live demo here: [PantallaVerde](https://pantallaverde.vercel.app/)

I built Pantalla Verde as a side project and I am very proud of testing different frameworks and strategies on it. The target audience are real estate entrepreneurs who want to learn new technologies around the AEC and RED industries (architecture, engineering and construction; real estate development).

User auth is handled in a simple PostgreSQL database. I use Stripe webhooks to manage subscription payments to the platform. Is written mostly in Typescript (89%) and deployed in Vercel.
