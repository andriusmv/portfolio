# Pantalla Verde

Pantalla Verde is an educational platform (SaaS) to learn about new technologies in the AEC/RED field (architecture and construction).
It involves user authentication and authorization (PostgreSQL with Supabase), front-end with NextJS, UI with plain CSS and payment processing with Stripe webhooks.

You can find the project repo here: [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andriusmv/pantallaverde) and the live demo here: [PantallaVerde](https://pantallaverde.co/)

I built Pantalla Verde as a side project and I am very proud of testing different frameworks and strategies along with it. The target audience are real estate entrepreneurs who want to learn new techniques around the AEC and RED industries (architecture, engineering and construction, real estate development).

User auth is handled in a simple PostgreSQL database. I use Stripe webhooks to
manage subscription payments to the platform. Is written mostly in Typescript
(89%) and deployed in Vercel.

And this is a basic db schema I came up with: users can belong to many
organizations and organizations can access have multiple plans (Free, Pro, etc).
I followed David Sacks advice that average users (consumers) have higher churn
rates (in SaaS), whereas enterprise (businesses) have smaller churn rates.
Similar to Figma (r.i.p.) or Miro app, where you can user for free as an
individual and later on you would ask your employer to upgrade to a paid plan
for the whole company (bottom-up approach).
