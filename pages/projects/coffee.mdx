# Angelopolis Coffee Program Monitoring

AngelÃ³polis is a municipality in the department of Antioquia in Colombia. It is a key player in the region's coffee ecosystem.

Municipal administrations have done their bit to promote a programs for local coffee growers by helping with budget, infrastructure and technical training for years.

But one of the biggest challenges that the municipal administrations have faced has been the lack of information regarding all coffee growers and their assets in the municipality. For the approval of budgets and the search for external aid in the departmental and national government, it is was necessary to have an updated and digitized version of the coffee farms to avoid setbacks and reduce uncertainty.

To face this challenge, I developed a monitoring dashboard with the coffee farms registered in the program.

The dashboard's main purpose is to serve as a monitoring tool in the municipality's
headquarters in AngelÃ³polis:

Some pictures of the process. Drone flights were made to obtain aerials of up to
5 cm/px of spatial resolution. A satellite image (consumed as WMS) of 50 cm/px was
also used to compare performance and provide context for some of the plantations.

IoT devices were implemented in one of the coffee farms as a proof of concept to
increase precision of weather data reported to the coffee program:

The indoor device was used in parallel to a weather station and a physical dashboard
indoors:

<br />
A sample size was stablished based on the quantity of plants for each coffee plantation.
The selected sample was inspected in site with Survey123 to collect data on overall
plant health, plant disease and bean color indicators.
