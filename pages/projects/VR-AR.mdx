# Virtual Reality VR and Augmented Reality AR

I enjoy testing and playing with VR/AR technologies. I have personally made more than 32 virtual tours using commercial 360° cameras and drones and I have also made 3d virtual tours, using open source software Blender.

Here is a conference I gave during the GeoCharlas summit in 2021 about VR/AR for the geomatics sector:

Here is a sample of a VR 3d tour I made for a metropolitan garbage trucks logistics center (you can rotate and look around during the 360° video):

More experiments run for terrain elevations and DEM formats in VR/AR:
