# GIS projects

I've been around GIS for more than 7 years. Up until recently, I took part in a geospatial analysis program -the Reservoir Conservation Programme- at [EPM](https://cu.epm.com.co/clientesyusuarios/) that aimed to build public infrastructure around reservoir and dam areas, spanning in more than 60,000 ha in Colombian territory. I was employed full-time as an architect and GIS analyst.

Most of the time I extracted layers of geospatial information from public and proprietary databases, including raster (drone and satellite imagery) and vector information. Processed with GIS software tech (PostgreSQL, QGIS and ArcGIS).
Additionally, I prepared applications for urban planning and building control approval using GIS and BIM software. You can find the final document here: [Reservoir Conservation Initiative](https://online.flippingbook.com/view/1060621149/)

I also implemented VR/AR and drone technology, which led to a 35%+ decrease of site visits and overall reduction of execution time.

# More traditional GIS work and technologies
<br />
I have worked using ESRI's ArcGIS (ArcGIS Pro and previous versions) but also open source tools like QGIS. I enjoy working with open data information as well as propietary data, wheter it's raster data (drones, satellite imagery like Planet or Google Earth Engine) or vectorial data (points, lines, polygons, etc).

I am a proffessional drone pilot and I have a broad understanding of UAV imagery and autonomous flight missions. I've used mostly DJI drones as well as DIY drones like iFlight. On the software side I'm familiar with DroneDeploy, Pix4D and Agisoft Metashape.<br />

These images belong to the Malena Master Plan development, where I was hired as an individual consultant to perform GIS analytics and coordinate with other proffesionals (environmental, forestry, legal, geology, etc). This is what the final document looks like [La Malena Masterplan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yLbE5iAuCbjBESRActxBs1sq7XFBGz0_/view?usp=sharing)

Other works include the Santa Elena River Basin Masterplan, where I conducted GIS analytics and Architectural/Urban Planning for a deprived area of the city of Medell√≠n, in Colombia.
