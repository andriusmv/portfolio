# GIS projects

I've been around GIS for more than 7 years. Up until recently, I took part in a geospatial analysis program -the Reservoir Conservation Programme- at [EPM](https://cu.epm.com.co/clientesyusuarios/) that aimed to build public infrastructure around reservoir and dam areas, spanning in more than 60,000 ha in Colombian territory. I was employed full-time as an architect and GIS analyst.

Most of the time I extracted layers of geospatial information from public and proprietary databases, including raster (drone and satellite imagery) and vector information. Processed with GIS software tech (PostgreSQL, QGIS and ArcGIS).
Prepared applications for urban planning and building control approval using GIS and BIM software.

I also implemented VR/AR and drone technology, which led to a 35%+ decrease of site visits and overall reduction of execution time.
