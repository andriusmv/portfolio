# Deep Learning and AI

I enjoy playing with deep learning models and training my own. In the following image I show a sneak peak into a deep learning package specifically to detect coffee plants. It's being trained with FasterRCNN and 5-cm resolution drone images.

# Dashboards and low-code tools

I enjoy creating dashboards with open data and implementing them along with story maps and other Esri-related solutions. Here, I explored data from the World Bank related to life expectancy across the world during a workshop with folks from the Journalism Master program at El Mundo.
